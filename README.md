### Components

1. **Calendar.js**

   This component renders the calendar view. It includes:
   - Logic to display days of the current month.
   - Navigation between months and years.
   - Handling click events to open a modal for adding/editing events.

2. **EventModal.js**

   This component renders a modal for adding or editing events. It includes:
   - Input fields for event name, start time, end time, and description.
   - Buttons to save the event or cancel the action.

3. **EventList.js**

   This component displays a list of events. It includes:
   - Logic to filter events based on the search keyword.
   - Handling delete actions for events.

### Logic Explanation

1. **Calendar Logic**:
   - The calendar is displayed using a grid layout. The days are dynamically generated based on the current month and year.
   - Navigation between months and years is handled by updating the state variables (`currentMonth` and `currentYear`).
   - The days of the week (Sunday to Saturday) are displayed at the top, and the days of the month are displayed in the grid.

2. **Event Management**:
   - Events are managed using the `useState` hook. Events are stored in an array, and each event has properties like `id`, `date`, `name`, `startTime`, `endTime`, and `description`.
   - Adding or editing an event opens a modal with input fields. The event data is saved in the state array and persisted in `localStorage`.

3. **Filtering Events**:
   - Events can be filtered using a search keyword. The `filteredEvents` array is generated by filtering the `events` array based on the keyword.
   - The filtered events are displayed in the `EventList` component.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Events are stored in `localStorage` to persist data between page refreshes. The `useEffect` hook is used to update `localStorage` whenever the `events` state changes.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout adjusts for different screen sizes using CSS media queries. On desktop, the filter section and calendar are displayed side by side. On mobile devices, the filter section is displayed under the calendar.
